description: "L'Argent (\"Money\") is the eighteenth novel in the Rougon-Macquart\
  \ series by Émile Zola. It was serialized in the periodical Gil Blas beginning in\
  \ November 1890 before being published in novel form by Charpentier et Fasquelle\
  \ in March 1891.\nThe novel focuses on the financial world of the Second French\
  \ Empire as embodied in the Paris Bourse and exemplified by the fictional character\
  \ of Aristide Saccard. Zola's intent was to show the terrible effects of speculation\
  \ and fraudulent company promotion, the culpable negligence of company directors,\
  \ and the impotency of contemporary financial laws.\nAristide Saccard (b. 1815 as\
  \ Aristide Rougon) is the youngest son of Pierre and Félicité Rougon. He is first\
  \ introduced in La fortune des Rougon. L'argent is a direct sequel to La curée (published\
  \ in 1871), which details Saccard's first rise to wealth using underhanded methods.\
  \ Sensing his unscrupulous nature, his brother Eugène Rougon prompts Aristide to\
  \ change his surname from Rougon to Saccard.\nAristide's other brother Pascal is\
  \ the main character of Le docteur Pascal. He also has two sisters: Sidonie, who\
  \ appears in La curée, and Marthe, one of the protagonists of La conquête de Plassans.\n\
